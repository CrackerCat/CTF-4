This is an interesting game for beginners, so I post this write-up.

This site shows a total black site. After looking at the CSS source, we will see it use black as background color.

After changing the background color,  we still can not see anything. Then look at the summary, find it  has a property of ``display: none; ``, just change it to ``display: block;``, we will see the flag is ``IceCTF{styles_turned_the_lights}``
